# Project: Identify Customer Segments

## Description

In this project, real-life data is provided by Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. The aim is to use **unsupervised learning** techniques to organize the general population into **clusters**, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, **data needs to be cleaned** in order to convert the data into a usable form.
