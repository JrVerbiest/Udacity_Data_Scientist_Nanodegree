# Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

**Objectives:** learn the skills you need to perform well as a data scientist with a focus on machine learning (supervised, unsupervised and neural networks).

<br>

## **Term 1: Machine Learning for Data Scientists**

**Period: 27 November 2018 - 24 February 2019**

<br>

**Project 1: Supervised Learning.** 

*Find Donors for the CharityML.*

- CharityML is a fictitious charity organization that provides financial support for people learning machine learning. To improve donor outreach effectiveness, an algorithm is built that best identifies potential donors. The goal will be to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield.

**Project 2: Deep Learning.** 

*Create an Image Classifier.*

- In this project, an image classification application is implemented using a deep learning model on a dataset of images and the trained model is used to classify new images. First, develop code in a Jupyter notebook using PyTorch, second convert it into a python application that you will run from the command line of your system.

  This project is the same as the final AI Programming with Python Nanodegree project.

**Project 3: Unsupervised Learning.** 

*Creating Customer Segments.*

- The data and design for this project is provided by Arvato Financial Services. Apply unsupervised learning techniques on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. Preprocess the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and implement clustering algorithms to segment customers to optimize customer outreach for a mail-order company.
